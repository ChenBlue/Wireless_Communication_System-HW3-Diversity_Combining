# Wireless_Communication_System-HW3-Diversity_Combining
This is the homework from COM5170 **Wireless Communication** in National Tsing Hua University. We are going to implement several diversity combining strategies. The requirements are shown as following. </br>
There are L (L = 1, 2, 3, 4) diversity branches of uncorrelated Rayleigh/Ricean fading signals. The average symbol energy-to-noise power ratio Es/N0 of each branch is 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 dB. Simulate the QPSK bit error rate for
1. Selective Combining
2. Maximal Ratio Combining
3. Equal Gain Combining
4. Direct Combining
