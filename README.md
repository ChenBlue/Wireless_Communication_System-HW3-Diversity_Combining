# Wireless_Communication_System-HW3-Diversity_Combining
This is the homework from COM5170 **Wireless Communication** in National Tsing Hua University. We are going to implement several diversity combining strategies. The requirements are shown as following. </br>
There are L (L = 1, 2, 3, 4) diversity branches of uncorrelated Rayleigh/Ricean fading signals. The average symbol energy-to-noise power ratio Es/N0 of each branch is 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 dB. Simulate the QPSK bit error rate for
1. Selective Combining
2. Maximal Ratio Combining
3. Equal Gain Combining
4. Direct Combining

## Implementation
### Selective Combining
Select the branch with highest signal-to-noise from received signal. 
SNR of received signal: </br>
$$ SNR=\frac{|g_k |^2 E_s}{E[n^2 ]}, k=1~L $$
Because $\frac{E_s }{E[n^2 ]}$ is fixed, we only have to find largest $|g_k |^2$ among all branches. </br>
Next, compensate the phase shift $\phi _m $, where $g_k=\alpha _k e^{j\phi _k }$
$$ r(t)=\tilde{r}_m (t)\times e^{-j\phi _m } $$

### Maximal Ratio Combining
The diversity branches are weighted by their complex fading gains and then combined.
$$ r(t)=\sum \_{k=1} ^L g_k ^* \tilde{r}(t)=\sum \_{k=1} ^L g_k ^* g_k \tilde{s}(t)+\sum \_{k=1} ^L g_k ^* \tilde{n}(t)=\sum \_{k=1} ^L |Î±_k |^2 \tilde{s}(t)+noise $$

### Equal Gain Combining
Since QPSK has equal energy symbols, EGC is useful. The diversity branches are not weighted. We compensate the phase shift and combine all branches.
$$ r(t)=\sum \_{k=1} ^L e^{-j\phi _k } \tilde{r} _k (t)=\sum \_{k=1} ^L e^{-j\phi _k } g_k \tilde{s}(t)+\sum \_{k=1}^L e^{-j\phi _k } \tilde{n}_k (t)=\sum \_{k=1} ^L \alpha _k \tilde{s}(t)+noise $$
